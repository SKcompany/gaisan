/**
 * @mainpage Gaisan - fast numerical methods in computational science
 * 
 * Gaisan is a library of numerical methods that are the subject of
 * computational science. Gaisan is defined to be efficient, fast, and
 * lightweight. Gaisan is written in C11 and is designed to be fast and
 * minimalistic.
 *
 * Gaisan is organised into different sections, each covering different aspects
 * of mathematics. The Gaisan documentation is generated via Doxygen and Gaisan
 * code is designed to be as self-documenting as possible.
 *
 * If this is your first time looking at the codebase, the best place to start
 * is the file index.
